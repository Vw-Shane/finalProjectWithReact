	 lines 13-19 are the current way images get loaded so they can be drawn later
	 line 23 calls line 162-185 which involves using a for loop to load the images I 	 haven’t figured out how to then draw the images though 
	 94-97 were going to be layouts for the images like the rectangles and circles 
	 108 will be what is seen if there is no image

Make game where you can jump through blocks and if you go over the gaps you fall Why do you fall? There is an item that indicates the users falls a fan a or lava something or other
Limit the enemies from falling ? Or maybe have them just disappear if they are in the fall area
